# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a simple React-based implementation of the classic Hangman word-guessing game.

## Game Rules

1. The goal of the game is to guess the hidden word before the hangman is fully drawn.

2. You can guess letters one at a time by clicking on the available letters.

3. If the guessed letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the correct positions.

4. If the guessed letter is not in the word, the hangman drawing will progress.

5. You have a total of 6 incorrect guesses before you lose the game.

6. You win the game if you correctly guess all the letters in the word before making 6 incorrect guesses.
